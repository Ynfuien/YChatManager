#### Quick info:
# 1. If you don't want a message to be sent, just set it empty - ''

# 2. You can use MiniMessage formatting for custom colors and formats!
# If you don't know how, then here is documentation:
# https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html

# 3. PlaceholderAPI is supported

# 4. Plugin placeholders are within curly brackets - {placeholder}
# If you add an exclamation mark (!) before placeholder name - {!placeholder},
# then it won't be formatted in any way. It's useful for user input placeholders,
# so they won't be formatted by what player enters.


# Prefix that will be used for {prefix} placeholder
